# Personal Library

A foundational JavaScript implementation of a library app where users can manage their collection of books. This is a work in progress, with future plans to incorporate a database and improved visuals.

## Features (Current Version)

1. **Book Management**:
   - Add and remove books from the library.
   - Track page numbers for each book.
   - Mark books as read or unread.

2. **Code Readability**:
   - Refactored from object constructors to JavaScript class syntax for cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Planned Enhancements

1. **User Accounts**:
   - Implement a database to allow individual users to log in and maintain a personalized library state.

2. **Visual Interface**:
   - Build an engaging front-end for the library app, improving user experience and interactivity.

## Skills Demonstrated

- JavaScript
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Software Project Management
- Code Refactoring and Readability

## Lessons Learned

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Treating the core logic and the front-end visuals as distinct layers led to a smoother development process and clearer code organization.

2. **Refactoring for Clarity**:
   - Transitioning the codebase from object constructors to class syntax highlighted the value of writing code that is easy to understand and maintain.

3. **Iterative Development**:
   - Revisiting and improving the project after a few months reinforced the importance of building readable and modular code.

## How to Run the Library App
